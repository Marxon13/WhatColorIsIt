WhatColorIsIt
=============

A simple screensaver that displays the current time. The background color is the current time converted into a hex string. Based off of [WhatColorIsIt](http://whatcolourisit.scn9a.org). Written as an example of a simple screen saver written in Swift 2. A small project to figure out how to write a debuggable screen saver, with a configuration panel before I start a more complicated one.

I've included a complied bundle if the screen saver for those who just want to download it and not mess with Xcode. It's the "WhatColorIsIt.saver" file in the root of the repo.
